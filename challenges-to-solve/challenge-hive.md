# Hive Challenge

We need your help! We have formed a startup to produce an online version of the [table top game hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)).

We've already invested heavily in the startup and had the [front end developed](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/fma-hex-renderer#readme) by Bob, our rockstar developer. 

Unfortunately Bob was so good that recruiters heard about him and now's he's joined Google. Bob's parting comment was that we don't need to worry, he's left us in a good space. He's already created a clear contract for the front end to communicate with the back end. All we need to do is get someone to implement the backend against that contract!

That's where you come in! You are going to write the backend for us. It needs to be done in either Java or C# and you cannot change the contract set in the front end. Because we are a startup and looking for future funding we want you to implement the rules of the game in iterations. We can't afford a Business Analyst so you are going to have to figure out what the appropriate slices are to deliver. Remember, limit waste!

# Hive Challenge

We need your help! We have formed a startup to produce an online version of the [table top game hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)). We've already invested heavily in the startup and had the [front end developed](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/fma-hex-renderer#readme) by Bob, our rockstar developer. 

Unfortunately Bob was so good that recruiters heard about him and now's he's joined Google. Bob's parting comment was that we don't need to worry, he's already created a clear contract for the front end to communicate with the backend. All we need to do is get someone to implement the backend against that contract. That's where you come in, you are going to write the backend for us! 

The backend needs to be done in Java or C#. While you may have some frontend skills we've decided you cannot change the contract set in the front end. Because we are a startup and looking for future funding we want you to implement the rules of the game in iterations. We can't afford a Business Analyst so you are going to have to figure out what the appropriate slices are to deliver. 

While we are a startup, we've learned through painful past experience that poorly written code while easy to write upfront costs us money down the road. We want quality code from you! Also, if you haven't played the game before we recommend you first get used to playing it manually. We have a physical copy of the game in each MYOB office.

Good luck!

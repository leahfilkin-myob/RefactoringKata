# Http Basic Web Application Kata

It's the late 1990s and the internet has just begun to flourish. You have a brilliant idea to build a Hello World web application however there are no MVC frameworks for you to use.

You need to implement a basic Hello World web application without using any frameworks. 

When calling the web application from a browser it should return a greeting with your name and the current date/time of the server. 

For instance, if your name was Bob when hitting the web server (http://localhost:8080) the browser would display "Hello Bob - the time on the server is 10:48pm on 14 March 2018" 

_(Yes, we know we said you were in the 1990s... but we want you to use your current servers date/time ;-))_

To make your life easier we have got starting points for Java and C#

## To summarise 

* Keep with standard libraries, don't use frameworks like Spring/Dropwizard or equivalent  
* Try implement all the dispatching code manually.  
* Include in your solution a test case for proving that the "greeting" portion of the system is functioning correctly.  

## Java Starting Point

If you are working in Java, instead of using Spring/Dropwizard only deal with standard libraries and implement all the dispatching code manually. There is a standard library [HttpServer class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpServer.html) in the jdk.  

~~~
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;

import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;

public class Test {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(8000), 0);
        server.createContext("/test", new MyHandler());
        server.setExecutor(null); // creates a default executor
        server.start();
    }

    static class MyHandler implements HttpHandler {
        @Override
        public void handle(HttpExchange t) throws IOException {
            String response = "This is the response";
            t.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());
            OutputStream os = t.getResponseBody();
            os.write(response.getBytes());
            os.close();
        }
    }

}
~~~

__It is worth mentioniong that using the com.sun. packages is generally a no-no, but for this exercise it is fine__

## CSharp Starting Point

If you are working in C#, create with ASP.Net Core avoiding any middleware. The basic asp.net core without any built in middleware would look something like this...

~~~
WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .Configure(app =>
                {
                    app.Run(async context =>
                    {
                        context.Response.StatusCode = 200;
                        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Hello");
                    });
                })
                .Build()
                .Run();
~~~

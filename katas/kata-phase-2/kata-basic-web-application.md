# Basic Web Application Kata

This kata will be enhanced and built upon throughout the second phase of your acceleration. The basic requirements are simple, however there will be a larger focus on building other aspects of your project. 

This kata will be used for your second quorum review, which will not involve looking at any of your code. Instead we will focus on four other key areas of software development: API Design, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery/Deployment and Security.

## Requirements

You will develop an API that maintains a list of names. You should be able to:
* Create a new name.
* Read an existing name.
* Read a list of all names.
* Update an existing name.
* Delete an existing name.

The learning objectives will guide you through implementing the API. You will end with an API project that:
* Is well documented and uses industry standards
* Automatically tests and builds your project artefacts
* Automatically deploys your project into a production-ready environment
* Has security built-in

## Learning Objectives

Guidance on how to use this kata to achieve your learning objectives is outline in this document:
* [Acceleration Phase 2 Learning Objectives](phase-2-learning-objectives.md)

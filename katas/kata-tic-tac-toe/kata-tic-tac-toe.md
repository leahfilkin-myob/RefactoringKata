# Tic Tac Toe Kata

Tic Tac Toe is one of the few games that transcends cultures and continents, it is easily understood and cost nothing to play.

In this code kata, we look to implement several levels of difficulty on Tic Tac Toe.

## The rule of the game

### Game Play

* Two players are required for a game.
* Each player will assume wither an “X” or “O”.
* Players take turn to play till a player wins, or the end of the game (whichever happens first).

### Condition for a win

* A player wins when all fields in a column are taken by the player.
* A player wins when all fields in a row are taken by the player.
* A player wins when all fields in a diagonal are taken by the player.

### Conditions for a draw

The game is drawn when all fields are taken on the board.

## Basic Tic Tac Toe

We are going old school. 

You need to implement a console based version of Tic Tac Toe that allows two human players to play the game on a 3 x 3 board.

It's really simple...  The first player will be the X, the second player will be the O. You keep playing the game until there is a winner, a draw, or someone gives up.

An example run through of a game console would be...

~~~
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!

Here's the current board:

. . .
. . .
. . .

Player 1 enter a coord x,y to place your X or enter 'q' to give up: 1,1

Move accepted, here's the current board:

X . .  
. . . 
. . .

Player 2 enter a coord x,y to place your O or enter 'q' to give up: 1,1

Oh no, a piece is already at this place! Try again...

Player 2 enter a coord x,y to place your O or enter 'q' to give up: 1,3

Move accepted, here's the current board:

X . O  
. . . 
. . .

Player 1 enter a coord x,y to place your X or enter 'q' to give up: 2,1

Move accepted, here's the current board:

X . O  
X . . 
. . .

Player 2 enter a coord x,y to place your O or enter 'q' to give up: 2,2

Move accepted, here's the current board:

X . O  
X O . 
. . .

Player 1 enter a coord x,y to place your X or enter 'q' to give up: 3,1

Move accepted, well done you've won the game!  

X . O  
X O . 
X . .

The system should display appropriate messages for incorrect coordinates and a draw.

## Taking it to the next level...variations

There are a number of possible customizations that can be added as well.

### More User Friendly Tic Tac Toe

Allows users to customize their game.

* Allow players to pick their markers (standard is X and O)  
* Allow players to decide who goes first  
* Allow games to be saved and resumed later  
* Allow users to be able to play as many rounds as they want without having to restart the application.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Any size Tic Tac Toe

Refactor your code to allow Tic Tac Toe to work on any size grid. 

#### Constraints

* At the beginning of a game you should be able to determine what sized board you want to play - it should default to on a 3x3 but any size is doable up to a 10x10.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Bad Computer Tic Tac Toe

Implement a computer player for the game that is really bad.

#### Constraints  

* The computer player can pic a random position on the board each time but shouldn't pick a spot that has already been taken.  
* The human player will always be represented by “O”, while the computer player will be represented by 'X'.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Good Computer Tic Tac Toe

Implement a computer player for the game that is really good. The computer player should never loose and will win where possible.

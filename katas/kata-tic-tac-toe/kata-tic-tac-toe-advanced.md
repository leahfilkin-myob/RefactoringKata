Taking it to the next level...variations
There are a number of possible customizations that can be added as well.

More User Friendly Tic Tac Toe
Allows users to customize their game.

Allow players to pick their markers (standard is X and O)
Allow players to decide who goes first
Allow games to be saved and resumed later
Allow users to be able to play as many rounds as they want without having to restart the application.
Any size Tic Tac Toe
Refactor your code to allow Tic Tac Toe to work on any size grid.

Constraints
At the beginning of a game you should be able to determine what sized board you want to play - it should default to on a 3x3 but any size is doable up to a 10x10.
Bad Computer Tic Tac Toe
Implement a computer player for the game that is really bad.

Constraints
The computer player can pic a random position on the board each time but shouldn't pick a spot that has already been taken.
The human player will always be represented by “O”, while the computer player will be represented by 'X'.
Good Computer Tic Tac Toe
Implement a computer player for the game that is really good. The computer player should never loose and will win where possible.

# Beverages Prices Refactoring Kata
=========================

The goal of this kata is to practice refactoring away from a bad usage of inheritance.

The code computes the price of the different beverages that are sold in a coffe house. There are some supplements that can be added to those beverages. Each supplement increases the price a bit. Not all combinations of drinks and supplements are possible.

## The assignment is as follows
----------------------------

We are asked to add an optional cinnamon supplement that costs $0.05 to all our existing catalog of beverages. 

We think we should refactor this code a bit before introducing the new feature.

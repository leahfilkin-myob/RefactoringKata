# Tools of the Trade

We have several tools of our trade that you will need. Below are the most common ones.

## Laptop setup

Your mentor will help you get your laptop set up. 

## GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology) extensively. Your GitHub account should have access rights to private MYOB repositories. Work with your mentor if you do not have access to the necessary repos.

## Slack

We use [Slack](https://myob.slack.com/) constantly. Slack has many rooms, each with a specific purpose:

* [General](https://myob.slack.com/messages/C0299853F) - discuss things that interest everyone. 
* [Auckland Interns](https://myob.slack.com/archives/G7601F6GN) - discuss things that interest interns.

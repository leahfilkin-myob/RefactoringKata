# YAGNI 
### Basics
YAGNI or "You aren't gonna need it" is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that relates to the XP value of simplicity.
The basic premise of YAGNI is to avoid adding functionality until it is necessary, with the goal of minimising "code bloat".
YAGNI should be applied with other XP principles such as continuous refactoring, automated unit testing, and continuous integration.
Applying YAGNI alone, it can be argued, can cause poorly designed code and lead to large rework efforts.

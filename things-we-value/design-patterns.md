# Design Patterns
When it comes to software, Design Patterns are general solutions to problems we have found to be reoccurring. These solutions are not pieces of code that can be copied but rather a template that when understood and implemented correctly which can add long-term value to an application.

In many cases, specefic patterns are seen as a best practice and by making uses of these patterns it not only aids your application but also others whom may interact with the code at some point (help them understand the process and intent). 

Design patterns are not constrained to any particular language and can be implemented to its full benefit, depending on language capabilities. 

### Types of design patterns

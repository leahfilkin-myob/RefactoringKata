# Light on the hill

A *light on the hill* communicates an involved or complex technical vision.  The vision will typically involve and be relevant to a wide audience that is progressively working towards the vision over a long period of time.
Each vision is in itself a conceptual *light on the hill* (picture it in your mind) that informs the steps of a wider effort.

### Aims
They aim to succinctly summarise:
- The problems being addressed
- Any current state of the systems involved
- The desired or goal state of the systems
- The key steps involved in transitioning from the current to desired state

They aim to communicate a message to the entire organisation, not just technical roles.  As such they have extremely simple technical views of systems and describe customer experience impacts.

### A combination of 3 visions
Whilst the technical vision is central, where possible they should also explain the vision and journey from both a product and user experience perspective.
A *better* light on the hill is grounded on realising value for our customers and should involve a user experience journey, and this usually means a product journey is taking place also.
Describing these other visions and journey's makes the overall vision most relevant to all roles, including those in sales, marketing and support.

### How they are created
They are typically created through a series of workshops that involve the crews working on and impacted by the vision as well as any product, technology, sales, marketing or support stakeholders of influence.

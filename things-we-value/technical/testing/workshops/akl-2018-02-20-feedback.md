# Auckland TTD+Pairing workshop 2018-02-20

## Format of the 1h workshop

- Started out by asking the protégés what their understanding of TDD was, and through discussion expanded their existing understandings
- Moved on to an explanation of pairing (there were no existing understandings/experiences to build on)
- Shared the link to the GitHub repo for everybody to clone
- Began the Fibonacci kata on a single laptop: one facilitator driving with the protégés and other facilitator navigating.
- Once red/green/refactor and the strong-pairing flow had been sufficiently demonstrated, split the protégés into two of their own pairs and had them start the Roman Numerals kata for the remainder of the workshop.

## Keep

- Including pairing in the workshop - having the protégés teach/question each other was a big plus.
- Allowing the protégés to drive early on alongside a facilitator helped get them into the red/green/refactor mode of thinking earlier without the additional cognitive load of editor/environment/stack understanding.

## Improve

- 1 hour was not enough time to dive into this. Likely that a full code retreat will be much more effective, or failing that a series of workshops.
- There was a fair amount of time lost to inexperience with the IDEs etc.: it would be worth spending more time upfront with the protégés dedicated to basic editor efficiency (it is a thing we value!)
  - Suggest prescribing Jetbrains equivalent IDEs/plugins intelliJ/Rider/Resharper etc) from the get go.
  - There was a noticeable difference in speed/efficiency between the pair using Rider (who were much faster) vs the pair using VS Code (one of whom was a facilitator.)

## Stop

- Sharing GitHub details/instructions on cloning before pairing on the Roman Numerals kata broke the flow of the workshop significantly.

## Feedback from the protégés

- Protégés felt the workshop was rushed/needed to be longer

# Keyboard Confidence

We value developers being confident at the keyboard. We would encourage you to master the keyboard.  

Various tools are out there that will assist you in achieving this. At the basics, invest time in learning how to touch type - this will help you to be able to express your ideas quicker in code.

How fast should you be? **Disclaimer: this is my opinion** : I've found once you get to about 60 words per minute you see diminishing returns. If you are not up to 60 words per minute, invest time in improving your typing technique to get to this speed.  

## How to best learn

Investing 15 minutes each day on improving your typing is often the best approach.

## Resources to sharpen the saw

[Typing Master 10 for Windows](http://www.typingmaster.com/) - this is probably one of the best typing tutorials out there, unfortunately for windows.

## Staying sharp  

[TypeRacer](http://play.typeracer.com/) - a great way to keep the saw sharp by racing other people in typing

# The Basics of Linux

Linux is one of the most well-used operating systems for production applications across the globe. Originally released for free in 1991, now it has several million contributors all putting their collective will into making one of the most secure, and reliable platforms in use today.

## The Basics

[Linux](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html) is composed of several object primitives which make up an operating system. Understand what a file, directory, and process is in the world of Linux.

[The Command Line Interface](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html) is the primary method of interacting with Linux - even as graphical interfaces exist. Through your career, you will need to navigate modify, and create directory.

[File manipulation](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html) is also a critical bit. Know how to copy, move, or remove files.

## Checkpoint: Exercise 1

Try to make a directory using your Mac terminal, and create a structure for where you will put the code that you're working on.

## Advanced

[Redirection and pipes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html) are Linux's way of 'forwarding' traffic that usually goes to the standard output. 

[Permissions and access writes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix5.html) make sure that your files are only accessible by you and no one else. In the world of cloud computing where resources are shared, this becomes even more critical.

## Checkpoint: Exercise 2

Show the permissions of your current Documents and Desktop directories using `ls -la`

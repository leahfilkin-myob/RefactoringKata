# Sensible defaults

Sensible defaults capture the results of continuous improvement (Kaizen) and information sharing (Yokoten) to provide people with the tools, processes and techniques they need to develop software.

### Principles

As defaults, they are a starting point for new development, freeing a team from having to make many decisions before getting to the valuable part of solving a problem for a customer. In this way they act as enabling constraints.

They are sensible, because they have resulted from the experience of people in the organisation doing the work. They are improved via the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle:

- Plan an improvement
- Do an experiment
- Check if the results show the intended improvement and if so
- Act to make the new way of doing things the updated sensible default

Where possible the defaults can be adopted for existing software development efforts. When an existing codebase needs to be maintained, the latest default can be used in that work. This way the codebase slowly improves in the style of the default.

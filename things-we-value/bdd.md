# BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)

BDD has evolved out of the use and application of TDD. Dan North was one of the key instigators in its development; particularly his development of the JBehave framework and his contributions to the RSpec framework.

BDD focuses on:

- Where to start in the process of developing a solution
- What to test and what not to test
- How much to test in one go
- What to call the tests
- How to understand why a test fails

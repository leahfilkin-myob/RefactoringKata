# Quality Assurance

The objective of Quality Assurance (QA) is the prevention of mistakes and/or defects from being delivered in a software product. QA processes and practices can be applied at every stage of the development lifecycle, from gathering requirements through to smoke testing of a production deployment. Within an Agile delivery team, all members of the team are responsible for performing Quality Assurance. The QA role is the team's Quality champion/coach.

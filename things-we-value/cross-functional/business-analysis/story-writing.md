# Story Writing

User stories are the building blocks of agile software development. They provide:
- Boundaries of requirements for a piece of work
- Articulation of the user or benefitiary of the work
- Articulation of the function of the work
- Articulation of the value of the work

Stories can be written with different templates, but all should fulfill the above.

### History and background
In 1998 Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."
With Extreme Programming (XP), user stories became a part of the planning game.

In 2001, Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:
- The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible durable physical token to hold the concepts;
- The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often - - supplemented by documentation;
- The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.
